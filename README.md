# ismetcan

> **Interactive terminal CV of İsmet Can Bıyık — Software Engineer focused on real-world backend and full-stack systems**

Run this command to see my developer profile in your terminal:

```bash
npx ismetcan
```

---

## What is this?

`ismetcan` is an **interactive CLI portfolio** that presents my professional profile the way engineers actually like to see it — inside the terminal.

Instead of a PDF or a static web page, this tool allows recruiters and developers to explore:

- Who I am
- What I build
- Which systems I’ve worked on
- The live projects I’ve shipped

all from a single command.

---

## What you’ll see

When you run `npx ismetcan`, you will get:

- My professional identity and engineering focus
- My real-world tech stack (TypeScript, Node.js, React, NestJS, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Prisma, AWS)
- My experience at Duosoft, Smart Bee (UK), Elegant Ofis (Elit Hair & Elit Klinik)
- Direct links to **live production systems** I’ve built
- Access to my GitHub, LinkedIn, website, and email
- A QR code to instantly open my LinkedIn profile

This CLI reflects the same profile shown in my CV and real production work.

---

This project demonstrates that I:

- Ship real software
- Care about developer experience
- Build systems that actually run

This is my **terminal CV**.
